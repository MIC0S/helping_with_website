## Idk whatever i coded here, good luck figuring it out

### Work In Progress
1) Still have to work on showing who posted article
2) Only allows posts from authed users
3) Test & Debug (Im lazy, if you find any bugs, report them and ill fix them asap, not gonna debug myself :sob: )
4) Make it actually look good, not whatever the hell we have here right now

### Required libraries for this to work:
Side-Loaded
* flask
* flask_sqlalchemy


* datetime
* hashlib
* random
* string


PS: Requires working SQLite Engine to work on background, highly suggest to just run dockerized version.
